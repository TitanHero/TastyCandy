## A very cool Dark theme for VSC(Visual Studio Code)

!(/screenshots/shots.gif)[Very cool don't?]


**ok this theme, I could not upload it as it should upload a theme because I could not pack it, you know, those npm shits and the creator of the tool to pack, and I'm very lazy (I have a lot to do) so repair this problem, is not an option for me, but I upload the * Work Space * according to that it's already a theme, that's what VSC (Visual Studio Code) tells me, so this is easy, to configure it.**

> Instructions:
*Just open the file with VSC and the VSC itself asks you if you want to load the work space, you give it and you're done.*


### Remember that this Theme uses the coloring of syntax and the base of the theme Dark Pixel (It is very Cool you should review it)
